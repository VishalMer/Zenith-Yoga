                        <p>"For years, I suffered from chronic back pain due to sitting at a desk all day. Doctors suggested surgery, but I wanted to try alternative approaches first. I discovered Zenith and started with gentle Hatha classes.</p>
                        <p>Within six months, my back pain was virtually gone. The instructors taught me proper alignment and gave me exercises to practice at home. I've now been pain-free for two years and counting!"</p>
